DeepTalk Emotions
===============================

PyTorch implementation of the DeepTalk model described in *DeepTalk: Vocal Style Encoding for Speaker Recognition and Speech Synthesis* by A. Chowdhury, A. Ross, and P. David in IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing 2021 (ICASSP-2021). The code is applied to the domain of emotion recognition to investigate correlations between speaker identity and emotion state.
